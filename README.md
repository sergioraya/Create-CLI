# Create-CLI using Node.js
Created a basic CLI based on Scott Moss's Introduction to Node.js. 
Here, I learned how:
* To use the Node REPL inside VS Code Terminal
* Process and environmental variables
* Familiarity with NPM
* FS, exporting, importing, and require modules
* NPM i yargs
* Callbacks, promises, and Async / Await
* Set up a basic JSON database
* Use CRUD to interact with JSON DB
* Perform unit testing with Jest
* Create a basic local server
